# Validation rules for the lodging GeoPackage.
#
# Each rule is defined with a table name, error message, and a SQL query which
# returns rows that violate the rule. The query must return the row identifier
# (fid) and the invalid value as the first two columns, and may return
# additional columns for context.
#
# If the query returns no rows, the validation passes.
