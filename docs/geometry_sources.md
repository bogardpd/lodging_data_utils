## Metro Areas

### United States

For locations in the United States, the U.S. Census Bureau maintains Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSA).

- [2020 CBSA Map](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-maps/2020/geo/cbsa.html)
- [2024 CBSA Shapefile](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2024/CBSA/) containing geometry, titles, identifiers, and other metadata
- [Excel listing of CBSAs](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/demo/metro-micro/delineation-files.html)

### OECD Countries

[OECD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD) maintains Functional Urban Areas (FUA) for OECD member countries. (While the United States is included in OECD countries, we recommend using US CBSA data within the United States.)

- [OECD FUA Shapefile](https://www.oecd.org/content/dam/oecd/en/data/datasets/oecd-definition-of-cities-and-functional-urban-areas/fuas%20(1).zip) containing geometry, titles, identifiers, and other metadata
